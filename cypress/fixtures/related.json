        "description": "https://lewishowes.com/greatnessdelivered - Sign up for my FREE newsletter & get a dose of inspiration from our world-class guests, learn how to improve your life!\nDownload podcast episodes a week early! http://www.lewishowes.com/pod\nIf you want to learn how to overcome negativity and start living life on your terms then watch the full interview with Marisa Peer. \n\nBe sure to subscribe for more - https://www.youtube.com/user/lewishowes?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck Out The School Of Greatness - https://lewishowes.com/start-here/\n\nMarisa Peer was listed in Tatler’s Guide to Britain’s 250 Best Practitioners and was the only woman on the Men’s Health’s list “Best of British.” She has spent 25+ years working with an extensive client list, including royalty, rock stars, actors, professionals, Olympic athletes, CEOs, and media personalities. She has developed her own style that is frequently referred to as “life-changing.”\n\nMarisa also studied hypnotherapy at the Hypnotism Training Institute of Los Angeles, known as the best hypnotherapy training establishment in the world. She developed her own brand of treatment, Rapid Transformational Therapy, which is a combination of hypnosis, neuro-linguistic programming, and cognitive behavioral therapy. By guiding her patients into a state of relaxation and hypnosis, Marisa Peer is better able to find the root of psychological distress and provide suggestions in order to heal that distress. \n\nMarisa Peer also started the radical #iamenough movement. By just saying those three words repeatedly — “I am enough” — you can change your brain’s thought patterns and come to a place of self-love.  \n\nMarisa is the bestselling author of several books, including I Am Enough: Mark Your Mirror and Change Your Life, and makes frequent appearances on TV and radio. She’s helped thousands of people overcome a variety of issues, and is motivated to train others to do the same. Marisa Peer joined me on The School of Greatness back on Episode 695, and it definitely has been one of my most popular episodes to date! I was honored to have Marisa Peer return and speak again about the power of positivity in achieving our goals. \n\nOur thoughts have power over us. But we can have power over our thoughts.\nYou can follow me at:\nWebsite: http://lewishowes.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lewishowes/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LewisHowes\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lewishowes/\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@lewis\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewishowes/",

He’s the founder and director of The UltraWellness Center, is the Head of Strategy and Innovation of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, AND is the Board President for Clinical Affairs for The Institute for Functional Medicine.\n\nSomehow, in the midst of all this, he’s a twelve-time New York Times bestselling author. He’s also a regular medical contributor on several television shows and networks, including CBS This Morning, the Today Show, Good Morning America, The View, The Dr. Oz Show, and CNN.\n\nAnd, as if all that weren’t enough, Dr. Mark Hyman hosts the leading health podcast The Doctor’s Farmacy. On his podcast, he shares a wealth of information about how our food choices are affecting our health and what we can do about it.\n\nNeedless to say, he’s an expert. Dr. Hyman is one of my favorite people to learn from about health because he is so honest about what’s going on. He’s really got humanity’s best interest at heart.\n\nAnd he’s coming out with a new book (which we discuss in our interview)! After listening to this episode, Grab a copy of The Pegan Diet: 21 Practical Principles for Reclaiming Your Health in a Nutritionally Confusing World.\n\nBut for now, join me on Episode 1,075 to learn about how food can heal or harm our bodies, how we can live longer, and how we can improve mental health with Dr. Mark Hyman!\nYou can follow me at:\nWebsite: http://lewishowes.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lewishowes/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LewisHowes\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lewishowes/\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@lewis\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewishowes/",

        "description": "Millions of people have been empowered by Amy Cuddy’s groundbreaking TED talk — the second most-viewed talk in the history of TED — on body language.\n\nThe Harvard social psychologist’s research has been covered by NPR, The New York Times, Wired, Fast Company and more. She’s been named a Game Changer by Time, one of 50 Women Who Are Changing the World by Business Insider and a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum. Now she’s publishing her first book — Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges, in which she explains the science underlying body-mind effects such as ‘power posing,’ and teaches us how to use this science to become self-assured in high pressure moments — job interviews, difficult conversations, speaking up for ourselves and more. She’ll talk with Susan Cain, bestselling author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking.\n\nSubscribe for more videos like this: http://bit.ly/1GpwawV\n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/92ndStreetY\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/92Y\nTumblr: http://92y.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://Instagram.com/92ndStreetY\nVine: https://vine.co/92Y\nOn Demand: http://www.92yondemand.org",

Elle est connue pour avoir fait la promotion de la \"pose de pouvoir\", une technique d'auto-amélioration controversée. Elle a été membre du corps professoral de l'Université Rutgers, de la Kellogg School of Management et de la Harvard Business School. Le travail académique le plus cité de Cuddy se base sur l'utilisation d'un modèle de contenu stéréotypé qu'elle a aidé à développer, afin de mieux comprendre ce que les gens pensent des autres personnes et des groupes stéréotypés. \n\n------------------------------------------ \n\nIntervenante : \n\nAmy Cuddy : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN-XD3TbODV18Ghb_G3DUg/featured\n\nTraduction française : Ascension Succès\n\n------------------------------------------ \n\nÀ propos d'Ascension Succès : \n\nSite Web  :  https://ascension-succes.fr/\nBlog : https://ascension-succes.fr/blog/\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/AscensionSucces/\n\n ------------------------------------------ \n\nN'oubliez pas de vous abonner, activer la cloche pour savoir dès qu'une nouvelle vidéo est publiée, et n'hésitez pas à liker et partager la vidéo ! \n\n ------------------------------------------ \n\n#AmyCuddy #LangageCorporel #Communication #NonVerbal",

        "description": "Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy argues that \"power posing\" -- standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident -- can boost feelings of confidence, and might have an impact on our chances for success. (Note: Some of the findings presented in this talk have been referenced in an ongoing debate among social scientists about robustness and reproducibility.

        "title": "Six behaviors to increase your confidence | Emily Jaenson | TEDxReno",
        "description": "Research tells us that the way to get people to change is not to start with trying to change their attitudes alone, but to start with the behaviors associated with the attitudes. When people see themselves behaving differently, they can then think of themselves differently and the attitude change will follow. The six behaviors discussed that you could start today are derived from over 90 interviews with female executives in sports. \n\nEmily Jaenson’s motto is “Be so good they won’t forget you!” and this motto has carried her through her career to land her former role as General Manager of the Triple-A Reno Aces.  Upon accepting this role in 2018, Jaenson became the first female in Triple-A to hold the GM role in nearly 20 years. Jaenson leads a podcast, Leadership is Female, where she interviews executives in sport so that she and her guests can guide the next generation of female leadership forward and leads a team of sports front office veterans in their consulting business. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",
